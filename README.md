I made this project inspired by a case I made for a company. It's still under construction, so there are some bugs and places I want to change.

Known bugs:

Some objects caused by the pool system remain on the screen. I will integrate the pooling system I recently wrote into this project.
There are too many visual bugs, I need to use Task instead of coroutine.

WARNING :
You need to download Newtonsoft to run the project. While I was doing the project, Newtonsoft had not been launched yet.
